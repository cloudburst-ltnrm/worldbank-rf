# Applications of Random Forests in Land Tenure Research
Descriptive paragraph.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisities
#### Software
* **[R Language](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)** (Required)
  * Install the package for your operating system. This is all you need to get started in R.
* **[R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)** (Optional, but recommended)
  * R Studio is an interface for R which can make R programming much nicer.

#### R Packages
A package in R typically consists of a group of functions, and the associated documentation, focused on accomplishing a specific task or goal. R comes with the base package, which includes all of R's core functionality.

Please install the following packages by pasting the install code in a R Console. Once installed, a package can be loaded by running `library(package_name)`, at any time. Note that a package must be loaded to access it's functionality.
* caret (Required)
  * ```install.packages("caret", dependencies = c("Depends", "Suggests")) ```
  * The caret package provides an easy interface for building and testing many types of predictive models. Because it requires many R packages, it may take a couple minutes to install.  
* ggplot2 (Required)
  * ```install.packages("ggplot2")```
  * The ggplot2 package can make creating nice looking graphics intuitive. We'll use this package to create plots to analyze our predictions and classification trees.

To access the documentation for any function in a package simply type `?function_name` in the console. If the exact function name is not known, you can search all available documentation by typing `??function_name`.
